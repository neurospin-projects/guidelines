:+1::tada: First off, thanks frr taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to NeuroSpin research projects and its packages, which are hosted in the [neurospin-projects Organization](https://github.com/neurospin-projects) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Introduction

The [neurospin-projects Organization](https://github.com/neurospin-projects) was created to probe reproducible research by providing a place to share the code and data of our research projects. There are two basic reasons to be concerned about making your research reproducible. The first is to show evidence of the correctness of our results. The second reason to aspire to reproducibility is to enable others to make use of our methods and results. The following sections present some guidelines on how to contribute by submiting your research code and data.

## How Can I Contribute?

Nothing could be simpler, just make a request by email to create a new repository specifying the name of your project to one of the organization managers.

## Style Guide

All contributions may adhere to the following style guides:

1. All code should be compatible with the Python 3.

1. All code should adhere to [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) standards.

1. Docstrings need to be provided for all new modules, methods and classes. These should adhere to [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) standards.

1. When in doubt look at the existing code for inspiration.
